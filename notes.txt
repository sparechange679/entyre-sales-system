## 💼 Objective
Design and build fully responsive, styled authentication pages (Sign In and Sign Up) using a shared group layout. These pages must support email/password login, and follow the application’s theme and typography.

The design should take inspiration from the attached layout and adapt it into this application’s brand identity, following the theme and typography defined in `/screenshots`.


## ✅ Tasks
- Create a layout with proper structure, margins, and responsiveness.
- Ensure the design feels cohesive across both pages.
- Sign In and Sign Up pages should use common form components.
- Create email/password inputs and you can add other fields to adhere to the systems functionality.
- Style all components with Tailwind CSS using the theme in `/screenshots`.
- Make it Responsive.
- Design must work well across devices.
- Use mobile-first and accessible practices.

## 📦 Output Requirements
- `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` pages with shared layout
- Responsive, mobile-friendly, accessible forms
- Reusable form and provider components
- Assets must be sourced from `/public`

## 📝 Notes
- Keep UI modular and theme-aligned.
- Focus is only on frontend (UI). Auth logic will be implemented separately.
- Maintain clean code and proper folder structure.
